# TgMP
Multiprofile starter for Telegram/64Gram/Kotatogram
"Enables" the possibility to use multiple profiles in Telegram Windows clients (Telegram/64Gram/Kotatogram)

Portable versions of clients together with "modules" folder should be placed in the same folder with TgMP.exe
64Gram client should be renamed from "telegram.exe" into "64Gram.exe" to work

Start the clients by starting TgMP.exe and following onscreen instructions, don't start clients by themselves!
